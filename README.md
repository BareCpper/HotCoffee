# ModernCppStarter

Setting up a new C++ project usually requires a significant amount of preparation and boilerplate code, even more so for modern C++ projects with tests, executables and continuous integration.
This template is the result of learnings from many previous projects and should help reduce the work required to setup up a modern C++ project.

## Features
 TODO 
## Usage

### Adjust the template to your needs
//TODO:  Replace all occurrences of "Greeter" in the relevant CMakeLists.txt with the name of your project
  - Capitalization matters here: `Greeter` means the name of the project, while `greeter` is used in file names.
  - Remember to rename the `include/greeter` directory to use your project's lowercase name and update all relevant `#include`s accordingly.
TODO: Add [your project's codecov token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/quick-start) to your project's github secrets under `CODECOV_TOKEN`

During development it is usually convenient to [build all subprojects at once](#build-everything-at-once).

## Prerequisites

- Nrf Connect https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started/assistant.html
- Nrf Command-line Tools https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download

### Build and run the standalone target

Use the following command to build and run the executable target.

```bash
cmake -S standalone -B build/standalone
cmake --build build/standalone
./build/standalone/Greeter --help
```

### Build and run test suite

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to run the test suite.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test
cmake --build build/test
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 cmake --build build/test --target test

# or simply call the executable: 
./build/test/GreeterTests
```

To collect code coverage information, run CMake with the `-DENABLE_TEST_COVERAGE=1` option.

### Run clang-format

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to check and fix C++ and CMake source style.
This requires _clang-format_, _cmake-format_ and _pyyaml_ to be installed on the current system.

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test

# view changes
cmake --build build/test --target format

# apply changes
cmake --build build/test --target fix-format
```

See [Format.cmake](https://github.com/TheLartians/Format.cmake) for details.
These dependencies can be easily installed using pip.

```bash
pip install clang-format==14.0.6 cmake_format==0.6.11 pyyaml
```

### Build the documentation

The documentation is automatically built and [published](https://thelartians.github.io/ModernCppStarter) whenever a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is created.
To manually build documentation, call the following command.

```bash
cmake -S documentation -B build/doc
cmake --build build/doc --target GenerateDocs
# view the docs
open build/doc/doxygen/html/index.html
```


To build the documentation locally, you will need Doxygen, jinja2 and Pygments installed on your system.

### Build everything at once

The project also includes an `all` directory that allows building all targets at the same time.
This is useful during development, as it exposes all subprojects to your IDE and avoids redundant builds of the library.

```bash
cmake -S all -B build
cmake --build build

# run tests
./build/test/GreeterTests
# format code
cmake --build build --target fix-format
# run standalone
./build/standalone/Greeter --help
# build docs
cmake --build build --target GenerateDocs
```

### Additional tools

The test and standalone subprojects include the [tools.cmake](cmake/tools.cmake) file which is used to import additional tools on-demand through CMake configuration arguments.
The following are currently supported.

#### Sanitizers

Sanitizers can be enabled by configuring CMake with `-DUSE_SANITIZER=<Address | Memory | MemoryWithOrigins | Undefined | Thread | Leak | 'Address;Undefined'>`.

#### Static Analyzers

Static Analyzers can be enabled by setting `-DUSE_STATIC_ANALYZER=<clang-tidy | iwyu | cppcheck>`, or a combination of those in quotation marks, separated by semicolons.
By default, analyzers will automatically find configuration files such as `.clang-format`.
Additional arguments can be passed to the analyzers by setting the `CLANG_TIDY_ARGS`, `IWYU_ARGS` or `CPPCHECK_ARGS` variables.

#### Ccache

Ccache can be enabled by configuring with `-DUSE_CCACHE=<ON | OFF>`.
